Attaching and verifying EBS volume to the existing instance. 

Create a new volume (It has to be in the same availability zone as the instance to which you are attaching).
Attach a volume to ec2-instance (Note volume will be renamed separetly on kernel of ec2-istance)

Verification On ec2-instance:
$ lsblk (will list all the volumes)

check if the added device is empty
$ sudo file -s /dev/xdvf
If the above command output shows “/dev/xvdf: data”, it means your volume is empty.

Check file system of existing volume.
[ec2-user@ip-10-33-174-205 ~]$ mount | grep "^/dev"
/dev/xvda2 on / type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,noquota)

Format the new volume 
$ sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf

Mount the volume to required directory(here it is root)
$sudo mount /dev/xvdf /

Note:
By default on every reboot the  EBS volumes other than root volume will get unmounted. 
To enable automount, you need to make an entry in the /etc/fstab file.
In the format (device_name mount_point file_system_type fs_mntops fs_freq fs_passno)
